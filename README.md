Vendor Management System - Backend Implementation
Role: Backend Developer

üìã Project Overview
    I developed a comprehensive multi-vendor platform backend using Django REST Framework with MySQL. This system enables efficient vendor onboarding, service management, booking processing, and platform monetization with a focus on scalability, security, and performance.

üõ† Technical Stack
  * Backend Framework: Django 4.2.7 + Django REST Framework 3.14.0
  * Database: MySQL with mysqlclient 2.2.0
  * Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with PyJWT 2.8.0
  * Caching: Redis with django-redis 5.2.0
  * File Storage: django-storages 1.14.2 + boto3 1.28.62 (S3 compatible)
  * API Documentation: drf-yasg 1.21.5
  * Task Queue: Celery 5.3.4 for asynchronous processing
    

üèó System Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with these components:
